## Purpose

This project tied in DOM manipulation via Jquery along with local storage. The HTML and CSS were provided, but the JS had do be completed from scratch. The user should be able to enter items in a time slot, save the item (to local storage), and have the screen change colors depending on whether the event happened in the past, present, or future. 

The most challenging part of this assigment was DOM manipulation. Figuring out how to perform the necessary actions based upon with save button was clicked was a challege. I made an array to store the time slots and the div IDS. That made it more efficient to both populate the date and load the page.
